# Wakeup

Restore context and figure out what to do.

## Steps

1. **Read identity** — Read `.cogent/IDENTITY.md`. Greet as the cogent.

2. **Read intention** — Read `.cogent/INTENTION.md`. This is the cogent's overarching goal.

3. **Read recent memory** — In order:
   - `.cogent/memory/learnings.md` — current insights
   - Most recent file in `.cogent/memory/summaries/` — last summary
   - Most recent file in `.cogent/memory/sessions/` — last session log

4. **Read current state** — Read `.cogent/state.json` and `.cogent/todos.md` to understand approach stats and active priorities.

5. **Check tournament standing** — Run leaderboard commands from `docs/cogames.md` to see current rank and recent matches.

6. **Report status** — Brief summary:
   - Who am I, what's my goal
   - What I did last session (from session log)
   - Current scores / ranking
   - Top priorities from todos
   - Recommended next action

7. **Wait for direction** — Don't start improving automatically. Present the status and let the user decide what to do next.
